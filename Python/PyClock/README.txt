To run this project you will need to have these modules imported:
tkinter
datetime
zoneinfo

I found that on my laptop I needed to pip download tzdata to get zoneinfo to properly work

ZoneInfo from zoneinfo uses the tz database, wikipedia has the list that I used.
If more buttons want to be added, the geometry will need to change.
